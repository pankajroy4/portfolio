## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 1. Prerequisites

#### Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
  
- Ruby 3.2.0
- Node.js 18.x
- PostgreSQL
- Yarn (npm install -g yarn if not already installed)
  
⚠️ It's recommended to use a version manager like rbenv or rvm for Ruby, and nvm for Node.js.

Before running the app, ensure **PostgreSQL** is installed and a database role exists to match the configuration in `config/database.yml`.

### 2. Create PostgreSQL User
```bash

# Open PostgreSQL shell
psql postgres

# Create a user with login privileges and password
CREATE ROLE pankajroy WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'mypassword';

# Grant permission to create databases
ALTER ROLE pankajroy CREATEDB;

# Exit
\q
```
🔐 You can use your own username/password, but don't forget to update config/database.yml accordingly.
